## Install

Install **Maven** using [SDKMAN](../sdkman/index.md) with the following command:

```
sdk install maven
```

## Wrapper

The Maven Wrapper is an excellent tool to ensure that all developers use the same version of Maven. It is a set of files that you can commit to your project, and it will download the correct version of Maven when you run it.

To create the Maven Wrapper, run the following command:

```
mvn -N wrapper:wrapper
```

We can also specify the version of Maven to use:

```
mvn -N wrapper:wrapper -Dmaven=3.8.1
```

> **Note**: The option `-N` means non-recursive, and it tells Maven to execute the command only in the current project and not in the modules.

## Usage
