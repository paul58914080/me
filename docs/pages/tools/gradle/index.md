## Install

Install **Gradle** using [SDKMAN](../sdkman/index.md) with the following command:

```
sdk install gradle
```

## Wrapper

The gradle wrapper is an excellent tool to ensure that all developers use the same version of Gradle. It is a set of files that you can commit to your project, and it will download the correct version of Gradle when you run it.

To create a Gradle wrapper, use the following command:

```shell
gradle wrapper
```

This will create the following files:

```shell
gradlew # Unix shell script
gradlew.bat # Windows batch file
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar # Gradle wrapper JAR
gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties # Gradle wrapper properties
```
